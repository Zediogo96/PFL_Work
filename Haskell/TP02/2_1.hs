{-The Eq typeclass provides an interface for testing for equality. 
Any type where it makes sense to test for equality between two values of that type should be a member of the Eq class. 
All standard Haskell types except for IO (the type for dealing with input and output) and functions are a part of the Eq typeclass.-}
