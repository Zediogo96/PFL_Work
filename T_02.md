# Higher-order functions

## Map
**How to implement**
- map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
- map f [] = []
  map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs

map (+1) [1,3,5,7] => [2,4,6,8]

## Filter
filter :: (a->Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

filter (\n->n'mod'2==0) [1..10] => [2,4,6,8,10]

- List Comprehension
filter p xs = [x | x<-xs, p x]
- Recursively
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
    | p x = x : filter p xs --  
    | otherwise = filter p xs -- avança um elemento

## takeWhile and dropWhile
similar to take and drop, but works until a certain condition is met

## all & any
all p xs = and (map p xs)
all p xs = or (map p xs)

## foldr (f difícil de entender mas muito útil) [fold right]

f[] = z
f (x:xs) = x operação f xs

example
sum = foldr (+) 0

## foldl [fold left]

se o operador não for associativo, podem dar resultados diferentes 

## Composition
### Read it from right to left makes it easier

f xs = sum (map (^2) (filter even xs) 
is equivalent to
f = sum . map (^2) . filter even

# Infinite lists

take 10 (repeat 1) => [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
take 10 (iterate (2*) 1) => [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512]

## repeat, cycle and iterate
